# Server Penetration Testing & Vulnerability Assessment: From Reconnaissance to Exploitation

This project details a comprehensive penetration test and vulnerability assessment performed on a simulated target server (Metasploitable3). The core objective was to move systematically through the offensive security lifecycle: reconnaissance, vulnerability scanning, exploitation, and post-exploitation. The results demonstrate end-to-end expertise in securing server environments by identifying, exploiting, and providing remediation strategies for critical weaknesses.

### Skills Learned

- Advanced understanding of SIEM concepts and practical application.
- Proficiency in analyzing and interpreting network logs.
- Ability to generate and recognize attack signatures and patterns.
- Enhanced knowledge of network protocols and security vulnerabilities.
- Development of critical thinking and problem-solving skills in cybersecurity.

### Tools Used

- Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system for log ingestion and analysis.
- Network analysis tools (such as Wireshark) for capturing and examining network traffic.
- Telemetry generation tools to create realistic network traffic and attack scenarios.
